# Mister Sneaky Pants project

Welcome to my battlesnake (tadaaa)

I created this in the spirit of fun for coding, while hosting an event at
work (Nuuday A/S).

To get started I forked the community starter project from [770grappenmaker](https://github.com/770grappenmaker/starter-snake-kotlin)
who has made a starter template in Kotlin.

I'm normally a PHP developer, but try to take on new challenges, so when I first read about
why Kotlin was made, I thought: "why not make it in Kotlin?!"

And here we are.
Please bear in mind, that simply forking this project and adding it to [battlesnake.com](play.battlesnake.com) won't
get you up the ladder... As... this is a fun experiment and lots of this are still going
very badly!

But hey! I'm currently **rank 130** on the standard ladder, so let's duel sometime :)

You can see my [battlesnake profile](https://play.battlesnake.com/profile/jimmiw) and look at
how the snake is performing.
